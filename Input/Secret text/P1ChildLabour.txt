Childrens or adolescents participation in work that
does not affect their health and personal development
or interfere with their schooling,is generally
regarded as being something positive . This includes

development and to the welfare of their families ,
they provide them with skills and experience, and help
to prepare them to be productive members of society
during their adult life . The term child labour is
often defined as work that deprives children of their
childhood , their potential and their dignity, and
that is harmful to physical and mental development .
