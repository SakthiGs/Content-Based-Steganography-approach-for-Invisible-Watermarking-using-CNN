Global Warming
Global Warming is expected to have far - reaching ,
long lasting and , in many cases , devastating
consequences for planet Earth .
We can observe this happening in real time in many
places . Ice is melting in both  polar ice caps  and
mountain glaciers . Lakes around the world ,
including Lake Superior, are warming rapidly - in
some cases faster than the surrounding environment.
Animals are changing migration patterns and plants
are changing the dates of activity ,
such as trees budding their leaves earlier in the
spring and dropping them later in the fall, Josef
