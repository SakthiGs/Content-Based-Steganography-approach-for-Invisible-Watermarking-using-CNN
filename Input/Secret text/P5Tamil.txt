Tamil
Tamil is the oldest language in the world .
Tamil is one of the few living classical languages
and has an unbroken literary tradition of over two
millennia . The high level of diglossia exhibited by
Tamil, and the prestige accorded to classical Tamil,
have resulted in much of the vocabulary and forms of
classical Tamil being preserved in modern literary
Tamil , such that the higher registers of literary
Tamil tend towards the classical language . The
classical language also forms an important part of
Tamil-medium education - verses from the Tirukkural ,
a classical work , are, for example , taught in primary
school . The ordinary form of the modern language
used in speech and writing , in contrast , has undergone
significant changes , to the extent that a person who
has not learnt the higher literary form will have
difficulty understanding it .
