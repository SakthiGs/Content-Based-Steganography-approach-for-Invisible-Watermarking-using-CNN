Tamil
Tamil is the oldest language in the world_
Tamil is one of the few living classical langunsges
and has an unbroken literary tradition of over two
millennia.The highlevel of diglossiaexhibitedby
Tamil,andthe prestigpo accordpod to classical Tamil,
have resulted in much of the vocabulary and forms of
classical Tamil being preserved in modern literc -ry
Tamil,such thatthe higher registers of literary
Tamil tend towards the classical language_The
classical language also forms an important part of
Tamil - medium education - verses from the Tirukkural,
a classical work,are,for example, taught in primary
school_The ordinary form of the modern language
used in speech andwriting,in contrast,has undergone
significant changes,to the extent that aperson who
hasnot learnt the higher literary form will have
difficulty understanding it.
